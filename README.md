<h3>universal PSU for C64/C128/Floppy_Drives</h3>
<p>You can find the files of my PSU Project.</p>
<p>This is a DIY power supply unit f√ºr a C64 C128 or commodore floppy drive.</br>
All components are listet in the BOM file and all PDF files are in the PDF directory.</p>
<p>I bought all components from a german seller http://www.reichelt.de </br>
You can find all components there. The part numbers in the PDF could be found online.</p>
<p>If you want a PCB for cheap I have three PCBs left (17.11.2020) ... send me a personal request.</p>
