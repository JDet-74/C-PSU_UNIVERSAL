# C=PSU_UNIVERSAL
<h3>universal PSU for C64/C128/Floppy_Drives</h3>
<p>Here you can find my files for the C=PSU project.</p>
<p>This is a DIY power supply unit for a C64 C128 or commodore floppy drive.</br>
I used a standard MEANWELL PSU for the +5V and +12V power rails.</br>
For the 9V~ power rail I used a standard transformer with enough amps.</br>
I combined the MEANWELL switching PSU and the transformer with a developed PCB.</br>
All components are listed in the BOM file and all PDF files are in the PDF directory.</p>
<p>I bought all components from a German seller http://www.reichelt.de </br>
You can also buy from http://www.reichelt.com </br> 
You can purchase all components there. The part numbers in the PDF could be found on the <strong>REICHELT</strong> webpage.</p>
