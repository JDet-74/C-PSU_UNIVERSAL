# C-PSU_UNIVERSAL
universal PSU for C64/C128/Floppy_Drives
You can find the files of my PSU Project. This is a DIY power supply unit f√ºr a C64 C128 or commodore floppy drive.
All components are listet in the BOM file and PDF files are in the PDF directory.
I bought all components from a german seller http://www.reichelt.de 
You can find all components there. The part numbers in the PDF could be found online.
If you want a PCB for cheap I have three PCBs left (17.11.2020) ... send me a personal request.
